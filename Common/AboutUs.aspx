							<p>A Bank branches maintains a number of different types of safe lockers at some of its safe sites. On the request of its customers bank issues a locker to a customer who has an account with the bank. A locker can be held jointly by two or more customers also. Bank charges yearly rent on the locker from the customer which is directly deducted from the account of the customer. For operating a locker, a customer can give a request through the website specifying date and time of operation. The bank confirms the appointment and on the stipulated date and time allows operation of the locker. Bank allows only a maximum of 12 free operations of the locker in a year, subsequently it charges for the service from the customer. Bank also has a process for allocation and cancellation of a lockers. In general as the number of lockers are limited, therefore, bank maintains a queue of customer who have requested for the locker service. Study various requirements for such a system from an actual bank. Analyse the requirements in details and design & develop the online system.</p>
